Yesterday I took a quick photo of this butterfly on a wild mallow plant in our garden. I did some comparisons on the Internet looking at pictures of the Monarch and the Viceroy butterfly. I was once told that we don't get Monarch butterflies in this area but my specimen, even with it's tattered wing, matches the photo in Wikipedia almost exactly. I would guess the wing spread of my butterfly to be about 3 inches or less.

{"id":"309281205759574_999669540054067","message":"\"They come at dawn\"\n\nI find it odd how an image, viewed for the first time, can bring back a memory not pondered for many years.  As a boy, I remember my father telling me all sorts of interesting stories that had me hanging on every word.  Born in 1918, his life was much different, and full of hardships, I would never have to endure.  The stories of life during the homesteading days always had me riveted in silence, and brought clear visions of what things must have been like back then.  He told me once of a time he was woken up very early by the sounds of the farm animals in a state of panic.  He got up and looked outside the kitchen window, but it was too dark to see anything but shadows moving quickly across the yard in the pre dawn light.  It was a pack of coyotes attacking the chickens and turkeys.  Mustering up his courage he walked a few steps out the front door into the darkness with his old double barrel shotgun to save the flock.  He said he was too afraid to walk into the middle of the fight, so he fired a couple of shots into the air. The sounds of coyotes retreating into the wheat field was the last he saw of them that day.  As the sun rose he could see most of the flock had been destroyed.  He told me, \u201cThis is important to remember\u201d\u2026  \u201cThey come at dawn\u201d\u2026 \u201cYou have to be ready for them\u201d\u2026  This image was taken not too far from the old homestead, at first light.  When I downloaded the photograph and saw it for the first time\u2026 his words\u2026  \u201cThey come at dawn\u201d, were the first thing that came to mind\u2026  Although I knew he felt it was important information he was passing on at the time, I have yet to have to chase off a pack of coyotes from my chickens.  Mine are well protected by the freezer doors and the alarm system at the neighborhood grocery store\u2026   Good thing\u2026  As I don\u2019t think I would have the courage to walk into a fight like that either. ;) \n\nI am aware the subject matter of the story is still a volatile topic for some.  It is not my intention to create a debate on if coyotes are good or bad, I am simply sharing an old memory with a photograph.  I hope some of you, if you read this far, enjoyed it.  ;)","likes":25,"comments":25,"url":"https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xtf1/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/12039186_904541716248633_5180221518545677023_n.jpg?oh=cd0665f54ac1657b721a2eb412b4cd10&oe=56B4CB51"}

The center is a wonderful stop for anyone who wants a chance to see some birds of prey up close without cages. The day I went was a record breaking hot day (38.3C) yet the staff was very friendly, knowledgable and gave me the chance to hold 3 different kinds of owls.

With the number of predators in the area, I feared the worst when I hadn't seen it for a while. I was delighted tonight to spot it amongst its seven remaining siblings (there were originally 12). There were a few in this photography group who wondered what it was going to look like as it got older. Here it is surrounded by 6 of its 7 siblings for contrast - the first time I saw it was on July 10, so it is probably at least 3 weeks old.","likes":25,"comments":4,"url":"https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xaf1/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/11796416_843706689053639_3438731421002759728_n.jpg?oh=fed5e5b2659908463bc74c566c2d4e09&oe=5686596D"}

Coaldale is just a little bit east of Lethbridge.  If you are in the area, or looking for a destination to shoot photos, put this place on your list.  They have a flying demonstration in an open field as well, but I suggest you call ahead to find out what time it will occur.  All birds that are able to be released back into the wild are reintroduced as soon as possible.  The bird in this photo is apparently a Harris Hawk.
